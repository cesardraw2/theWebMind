Requires:
	PHP 5.3
	PHP-cli

Your HTTPServer's user must have permission to read and write on its folder

In your console, run:
	sudo php mind install

After the Ok message, go to:
	[yourMindDir]/mind3rd/SQLite
and set the permission to the "mind" file due to allow the PHPUser
to access the database.

You're good to go
